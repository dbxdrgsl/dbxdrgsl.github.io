  <h2>Why I Love GTA V</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The freedom of movement, choice, and storytelling — all bundled in one enormous sandbox</li>
    <li>The absurdity of switching between complete chaos and hyper-focused mission design</li>
    <li>The engine — its physical rules, its glitches, its internal logic — has a fascinating complexity</li>
    <li>The fact that it's still alive after all these years, and somehow still evolving through mods and multiplayer</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Speedrunner Brainrot</h2>

  <p>I’ve watched more GTA V than I’ve played. Why? Because of people like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DarkViperAU" target="_blank"><strong>DarkViperAU</strong></a> – a technician of frame-perfect logic, RNG analysis, route optimization, and philosophical monologues mid-run</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DougDoug" target="_blank"><strong>DougDoug</strong></a> – chaos incarnate, who turned "chat plays GTA V" into an actual experiment in collaborative disaster and game-breaking randomness</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I don’t just watch for fun — I watch to learn how systems can be broken, optimized, gamed, and reconstructed. GTA V is the perfect simulation playground for that.</p>

  <h2>Favorite Formats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><code>Chaos Mod v3</code> runs (with randomized effects every 10 seconds)</li>
    <li><code>No Damage</code>, <code>Pacifist%</code>, <code>One-Hit KO</code>, and other high-stakes challenges</li>
    <li><code>Bad AI</code> experiments and community-submitted mayhem mods</li>
    <li><code>Speedrun vs Viewer</code> decision branches — where analysis turns into reaction</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Closing Note</h2>

  <p>GTA V isn’t just a game. It’s a map of what happens when freedom, failure, and mathematics collide. I like playing it. But I love *understanding* it through the lens of those who take it to its mechanical and absurd extremes.</p>
