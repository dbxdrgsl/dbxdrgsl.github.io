  <h2>What San Andreas Was (and Still Is)</h2>

  <p>*GTA: San Andreas* wasn’t just a game — it was a *sandbox mythos*. It defined an era where everything was moddable, everything was exaggerated, and somehow it all worked.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Three cities, each with its own style and identity</li>
    <li>A storyline that escalates from gang drama to military infiltration without losing momentum</li>
    <li>RPG mechanics before they were trendy — fat, muscle, driving skill, territory control</li>
    <li>A soundtrack that made you feel *cool* just biking through Los Santos</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How I Experienced It</h2>

  <p>I played San Andreas at the perfect time — when imagination and jank were indistinguishable. I didn’t need ultra graphics. I needed the jetpack. The train mission. The hydra. The ghost myths. The chaos.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Learned cheat codes before learning English</li>
    <li>Installed weird mods and forgot how to uninstall them</li>
    <li>Tried to complete 100%... gave up at oysters</li>
    <li>Still remember where the chainsaw is in Las Venturas</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What It Taught Me</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Game structure:</strong> San Andreas was the first time I noticed how missions are sequenced, how cities unlock, how side systems sync</li>
    <li><strong>Modding:</strong> First exposure to editing files, changing textures, and breaking physics on purpose</li>
    <li><strong>Community:</strong> Forums, map theories, UFO sightings, and fake myth hunting — all before YouTube became the hub</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Still Legendary</h2>

  <p>To this day, I can launch San Andreas and feel instantly at home. It aged strangely. It broke often. But it remains technically fascinating and emotionally immortal. GTA V is impressive. But San Andreas is sacred.</p>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>

  <p>Somewhere in my memory, CJ is still biking back to Grove Street, the radio’s still on, and the chaos never really ended. Just got paused.</p>
