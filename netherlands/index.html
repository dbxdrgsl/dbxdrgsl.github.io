  <h1>/netherlands – Future Chapter</h1>

  <blockquote>
    “Somewhere between rain, bikes, code, and balance — I know I’ll feel at home.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Why the Netherlands?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Values match:</strong> Tech-driven, education-focused, progressive, multilingual, and unapologetically direct. Same as me.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional opportunities:</strong> Incredible hubs for game development, AI research, and education innovation.</li>
    <li><strong>Academic environment:</strong> International universities, open science philosophy, and a strong connection between theory and application.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal dream:</strong> I've been drawn to Dutch culture for years — from infrastructure to the way people value work–life balance and independence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Things I Admire</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The bike-first cities and green thinking</li>
    <li>The language balance: Dutch + English coexist effortlessly</li>
    <li>The universal respect for logic, freedom, and planning</li>
    <li>The transparency in both government and academia</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Plan in Motion</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Currently preparing academically and financially for a long-term transition</li>
    <li>Targeting university admissions, research collaborations, or remote-compatible projects with Dutch institutions</li>
    <li>Maintaining EU citizenship makes the logistics feasible — it’s the mindset and stability that I’m after</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A small apartment, a part-time research job, and a community of creative people with strong Wi-Fi</li>
    <li>Moments of rain, introspection, and weird cheese</li>
    <li>A place that respects thinking and building slowly — not just fast</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Closing Thought</h2>

  <p>This isn’t escapism. It’s evolution. I want to be somewhere that feels like a catalyst — not a compromise.</p>
