  <h2>My Thoughts on Spain</h2>

  <p>I don’t speak Spanish (yet), and I’m not in love with heat — but there’s something about Spain that pulls at me in a different register. A feeling of rhythm. Of time that flows slower, but deeper.</p>

  <h2>What I Admire</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The strong public culture: plazas, late dinners, city life that's alive well into the night</li>
    <li>The regional depth — Catalonia, Basque Country, Andalusia — all layered, complex, and full of story</li>
    <li>The emphasis on living well: food, friendship, and taking your time</li>
    <li>The architecture and mathematics in motion — from Gaudí to Alhambra geometry</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Spain as a Second Option?</h2>

  <p>If the Netherlands is my structured future, Spain is my poetic one. I don’t know if I’ll move there, but I know I want to understand it. Visit longer. Think slower. Maybe write there.</p>

  <h2>Possibilities</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Summer teaching programs, Erasmus+ collaborations, digital residencies</li>
    <li>Studying regional languages as a side project — Catalan or Basque, even</li>
    <li>Exploring university partnerships for ICT and educational technology projects</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Closing Note</h2>

  <p>I don’t romanticize Spain as an escape. I see it as a calibration — a chance to find out what pace actually suits me. Somewhere between the flamenco rhythms and philosophical siestas, there might be a version of me that feels more human.</p>
