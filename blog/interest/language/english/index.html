  <h1>/lingual – English Proficiency</h1>

  <p><strong>Proficiency Level:</strong> C2 (CEFR)</p>
  <blockquote>
    “You have mastered the language. You can understand virtually everything heard or read, and you can express yourself spontaneously, very fluently, and precisely.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Context and Justification</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Academic Experience:</strong> Studied mathematics, computer science, and physics primarily using English resources. Frequently reads and writes in formal academic English.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional Use:</strong> Teaches informatics using a bilingual approach and frequently translates or adapts content between Romanian and English. Prepares international-grade educational content for TIC classes (grades 5–8).</li>
    <li><strong>Research and Thesis Work:</strong> Writes technical documentation and formal research on topics such as <em>multi-dimensional polytope visualization in game engines</em>—all in English.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Fluency:</strong> Actively reads and writes documentation, code comments, GitHub issues, and project descriptions in English. Interacts with international developer communities.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Capable of composing formal emails, writing lesson plans, and giving technical explanations in English with clarity and precision.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Examples of Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Academic essays and summaries on <code>functional analysis</code>, <code>differential geometry</code>, and <code>topology</code></li>
    <li>Formal writing: <a href="https://dbxdrgsl.github.io/me" target="_blank">/me page</a>, thesis proposals, lesson outlines</li>
    <li>Educational materials for Romanian students explained in fluent English</li>
    <li>Long-form ChatGPT interactions in English involving rigorous math and programming terminology</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Certifications & Formal Evaluations</h2>
  <p>No formal certificate (IELTS, TOEFL, etc.) currently submitted, but level is demonstrably equivalent to C2 based on production, comprehension, and metalinguistic control.</p>

  <h2>Statement</h2>
  <p>I use English not just as a second language, but as the primary medium of learning, expression, and professional output. My fluency is rooted in academic rigor, technical discourse, and didactic clarity.</p>
